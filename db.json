        " 1.For the mousse, place chocolate in a large bowl. Heat cream in a small saucepan until almost boiling, then pour over the chocolate. Stand for 1 minute. Whisk until combined. Set ganache aside and keep warm to prevent it firming too much.",

        "5.For the salted caramel, place sugar in a high-sided, heavy- based pot over medium-high heat and leave untouched until sugar dissolves evenly, then gently swirl pan until sugar reaches a dark golden colour, around 166°C. Reduce heat to low and whisk cream in slowly to incorporate evenly. Remove pan from heat and whisk in butter, one piece at a time, until melted and well incorporated. Whisk in sea salt. Transfer to a large bowl and set aside for 20 minutes to cool slightly before serving (if left for too long, the caramel will firm up too much)",

Add a dollop of the salted caramel into the well. Top generously with mochi pieces and toasted buckwheat to serve."

Press the buttery rubble evenly into a 25cm top x 21cm base (5cm deep) fluted loose-based pie dish. Place in the freezer for 10-15 minutes to harden.",

        "3. Place the egg yolks in the bowl of a stand mixer with the whisk attachment and whisk on high speed until pale and thickened. Reduce speed to low and gradually whisk in the condensed milk, lemon juice, zest and salt. Add the gelatine and whisk until combined. Pour the creamy lemon custard into the crust, levelling it out with the back of a spoon, and set in the fridge to chill. It will keep happily for 1-2 days. Lift the pie crust out of its pan; if cold from the fridge, it should come out easily.",
        "4. For the meringue, place the eggwhites in the cleaned bowl of a stand mixer with the whisk attachment and whisk on high speed until soft peaks form. Gradually add the sugar, spoonful by spoonful, beating all the while. Keep whisking the meringue until it becomes thick and glossy, then add the lemon juice and vanilla extract. Whisk until well combined.",
        "5. Dollop the meringue onto the pie and spread it out so all the glossy, sunny filling is completely covered. Use a spoon to make small peaks in the meringue, then use a kitchen blowtorch to caramelise it, so the tips are lightly golden and burnished. The pie, in its fully assembled glorious form, will happily sit in the fridge for up to 1 day. Best served chilled."
